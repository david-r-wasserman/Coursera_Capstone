## This was my capstone project for the IBM course "[Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/welcome)", completed in 2019.

The assignment was to use the Foursquare API to query for location data, and choose an interesting question that can be answered with this data. I chose to investigate how venue categories could be used to deliver targeted advertising.

Report.md is a description of the project. 

All of the code is in Foursquare.ipynb.
