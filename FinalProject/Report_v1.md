# Targeting Consumers According to Venue Categories

## Introduction/Business Problem

Is a person visiting an art gallery likely to next visit a French restaurant? Is a person visiting a metro station likely to next visit a tailor shop? In general, is a person visiting a venue of category *x* likely to next visit a venue of category *y*? In this project, pairs (*x*, *y*) were found for which the answer is Yes.

This problem is relevant for delivering targeted advertising. Advertising seeks to change consumer behavior, but the most likely changes are those that remain within the bounds of normal behavior. Let *P*(*x*, *y*) denote the probability that a person visiting a venue of category *x* next visits a venue of category *y*. If *P*(*x*, *y*) is high, then it makes sense to advertise venues of category *y* to people currently located at venues of category *x*.
